Unrated Contest
After the success of our first two contests in this format, Magic Lines is back. Can you crack the code by figuring out the missing lines? Allowed languages are C++, Java and Python.
You are provided with most of the code required to solve each problem. All you need to do is to replace the question marks (???) to get the code up and running as it should. Do not insert more than 50 characters.
