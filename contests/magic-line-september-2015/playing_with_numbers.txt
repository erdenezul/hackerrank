Problem Statement

You are given an array of size N . You need to answer Q queries. Each Query contains 1 number x. 
For each query, you need to add x to each element of the array and then report the sum of absolute values in the array.

Note : Changes to the array are permanent. See Sample for more clarification.

Input Format

First line contains N , number of elements in the array. 
Next line contains N space separated integers of the array. 
Next line contains Q(number of queries). 
Next line contains Q space separated integers(the number x).

Output Format

For each query , output the sum in a newline.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 500000 
1 ≤ Q ≤ 500000 
-2000 ≤ number in each Query ≤ 2000 
-2000 ≤ value of the array element ≤ 2000

Sample Input

3
-1 2 -3
3
1 -2 3 
Sample Output

5
7
6
Explanation

After Query 1 : [ 0 , 3 , -2 ] => sum = 0 + 3 + 2 = 5 
After Query 2 : [ -2 , 1 , -4 ] => sum = 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 
After Query 3 : [ 1 , 4 , -1 ] => sum = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

NOTE : There is large input output in the problem .Be carefull with slow Input Output.

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

input()
array = map(int, raw_input().split(" "))
input()
queries = map(int, raw_input().split(" "))
buckets = [0] * 4001
shift = 0
for i in array:
    buckets[i + shift + 2000] += 1 # buckets from -2000 to 2000
for q in queries:
    shift += q
    if shift - q >= 2000 and shift >= 2000:
        s += ???
    elif shift - q <= -2000 and shift <= -2000:
        s -= ???
    else:
        s = 0
        for i, y in enumerate(buckets):
            val = i + shift - 2000
            s += y * abs(val)
    print s
